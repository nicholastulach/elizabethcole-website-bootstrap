#### The Longest but Honestly the Most Amusing Bio
Elizabeth Cole writes historical romance from the medieval era up to the Regency, and also contemporary paranormal when the need to write in modern slang grows too strong. Her dream is to have everyone know her name and no one to know her face. Writing is a big part of that dream. 

She has earned degrees in library science, history, and English. Educated as she is, Elizabeth still gets confused about when to use lie and lay. Since she often writes about espionage and sex, this is an ongoing problem. 

She was born and raised in Wisconsin, where people are nice even to their enemies. She now lives in Philadelphia, where everybody just grunts. A grunt could mean I love you. It usually doesn’t.
