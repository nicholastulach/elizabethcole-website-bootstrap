# About the Author

**Elizabeth Cole** is an author of historical romance. She can be found hanging around museums, coffeeshops, and graveyards…but not after dark.

She studied English literature and medieval European history in school, but found that not many jobs required knowledge of the quadrivium or the Crusades (shocking, right?). She went back to school for a Masters in Library Science, but later decided she liked writing books even more than cataloguing them.

As a writer, Elizabeth finds inspiration in lots of places, whether it’s art or movies, or TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Jeremy Brett-era Sherlock Holmes. She grew up reading lots of fairy tales and fantasy, as well as the detective stories of Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, PD James, Mickey Spillane, and Ellis Peters. And of course, she reads romance! Johanna Lindsay, Mary Jo Putney, Mary Balogh, and Sarah MacLean all get snapped up whenever a new title comes out.

When not writing, she watches extremely bad movies—the kind with more explosions than acting. (Sometimes those bad movies feature the silhouettes of a human and two ’bots in the corner…) Just a bit of a nerd, she also loves board games and tabletop RPGs. She can not divulge how many dice might be in her house at this moment. However, she does know where her towel is.

Connect with Elizabeth on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or by classic, old-timey email.

# About the Books

All my books and series are designed so that you can pick up any book and enjoy the story without needing any extra background. However, if you really like to go in chronological order and catch all the little references, you should follow the lists below. (Luckily, the order in which the series books were published is also the chronological order that they occur in.)

### _Secrets of the Zodiac_

This series is set in the early Regency, starting in 1806. I recommend reading the first three novels in order, because there is an overarching story in them. After that, it’s up to you! For the novellas, only Lady in Sapphire closely involves a character from the main series, but you can still read it on its own with no spoilers at all)

* _A Heartless Design_
* _A Reckless Soul_
* _A Shameless Angel_
* _Lady in Pearls_ — a Zodiac novella 
* _The Lady Dauntless_
* _Lady in Sapphire_ — a Zodiac novella (the hero is a character from Book 4 in the main series)
* _Beneath Sleepless Stars_
* _A Mad & Mindless Night_
* _A Most Relentless Gentleman_
* _Breathless in the Dark_

…and more to come!

### _The Swordsworn Knights_

These books can be read in any order, but the series does follow the heroes in order of their ages. So Alric, the oldest of the knights, gets the first book, and Octavian, the youngest, gets the last book, which happens about five years later. You’ll meet characters from previous books too, so if you don’t want the spoiler that some people get happily married, then you should read in order!

* _Honor & Roses_
* _Choose the Sky_
* _Raven’s Rise_
* _Peregrine’s Call_

### _﻿The Brothers Salem_

This is a series about three brothers, and the oldest’s is first, while the youngest’s is last. It’s best to read this trilogy in order because you’ll learn some secrets and meet important characters throughout the books.

* _Keep Me Close_
* _Reach for Me_
* _Wake Me Up_
* _One Touch of Silver_ – This novella is set a century before the main series. It can truly be read at any point, or even without reading the main series at all.
